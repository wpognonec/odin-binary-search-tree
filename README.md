# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in JavaScript

This project provides a JavaScript implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. It includes methods for building, manipulating, and traversing the tree.

## Features

- **Balanced Tree Construction:** Constructs a balanced BST from an array of items, ensuring efficient search and retrieval.
- **Insertion:** Inserts new nodes into the tree while maintaining the BST property.
- **Deletion:** Removes nodes from the tree, handling various cases (leaf node, node with one child, node with two children).
- **Search:** Finds a node with a specific value in the tree.
- **Traversal:** Provides methods for level-order, in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
- **Height and Depth Calculation:** Calculates the height of a node and the depth of a target node within the tree.
- **Balance Checking:** Determines if the tree is balanced.
- **Rebalancing:** Rebalances an unbalanced tree.
- **Pretty Printing:** Offers a visually appealing representation of the tree in the console.
